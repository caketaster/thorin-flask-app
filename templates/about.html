        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

                Nori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori,[1] and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield.

                He played the flute, and was very fond of regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.
